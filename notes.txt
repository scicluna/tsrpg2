load/parse world - possibly in chunks
init player object
init initial scene

Once the initial scene starts - if we design things right - it will just play all the way to the end while in the gameplay loop.

gameplay loop:
travel to location
Encounter/Dialogue
do Encounter/Dialogue
Either get linked to another encounter/Dialogue
or get a prompt to move locations
repeat.
